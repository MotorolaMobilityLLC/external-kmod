Features:
=========

* config: configs that do not need to be matched by fnmatch() could be using a
  vector instead of a list. This way we could search in it by calling
  bsearch().

* index: drop the "open(), seek(), read()" implementation and use another one
  with mmap(). When lookup() is called and the file is not mmaped, mmap it.

* create test-mock library to be LD_PRELOAD'ed before running the binaries
  so we're able to create unit tests

* provide ELF manipulation to implement modinfo

* Add functions to dump configuration

* Add functions list all modules known by modules.dep

* provide 1:1 compatibility with module-init-tools's modprobe
   - show modversions (needs elf manipulation)
   - dump configuration

Known Bugs:
===========


Notes for future development:
=============================

* Kill support for /etc/modprobe.conf

* Kill support for map files

Things to be added removed in kernel (check what is really needed):
===================================================================

* list of currently loaded modules

* module's size should be available under /sys

* kill /proc/modules ?
