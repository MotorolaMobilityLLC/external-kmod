Features:

* config: configs that do not need to be matched by fnmatch() could be using a
  vector instead of a list. This way we could search in it by calling
  bsearch().

* index: drop the "open(), seek(), read()" implementation and use another one
  with mmap(). When lookup() is called and the file is not mmaped, mmap it.

* create test-mock library to be LD_PRELOAD'ed before running the binaries
  so we're able to create unit tests

* provide ELF manipulation to implement modinfo

* Add coding-style.txt

* Add lookup for install commands in kmod_module_new_from_lookup()

* Add lookup for remove commands

* Add functions to dump configuration

* Add functions list all modules known by modules.dep

* Implement soft dependencies

* Parse kernel command line (modname.opt=val)

* provide 1:1 compatibility with module-init-tools's modprobe
   - show modversions (needs elf manipulation)
   - dump configuration
   - use softdep, install and remove commands
