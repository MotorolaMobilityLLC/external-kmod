kmod 1
======

First version of kmod and its library, libkmod.

In the libkmod it's currently possible to:
	- List modules currently loaded
	- Get information about loaded modules such as initstate, refcount,
	  holders, sections, address and size
	- Lookup modules by alias, module name or path
	- Insert modules: options from configuration and extra options can be
	  passed, but flags are not implemented, yet
	- Remove modules
	- Filter list of modules using blacklist
	- For each module, get the its list of options and install/remove
	  commands
	- Indexes can be loaded on startup to speedup lookups later

Tools provided with the same set of options as in module-init-tools:
	- kmod-lsmod
	- kmod-insmod
	- kmod-rmmod
	- kmod-modprobe, with some functionality still missing (use of softdep,
	  dump configuration, show modversions)
